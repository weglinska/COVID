# COVID Code Description
The code is written in R and requires several packages to be installed: dplyr, ggplot2, ggpubr, readxl, plotly, gridExtra, and viridis. Make sure to install these packages before running the code.

# Instructions
To run the code:

Install the required R packages: dplyr, ggplot2, ggpubr, readxl, plotly, gridExtra, and viridis.
Make sure you have an Excel file named "Data_covid.xlsx" containing the COVID-19 data in the same directory as the R code file.
Run the code line by line or as a whole in an R environment or editor.
The code will read the data, process it, calculate various ratios and expected values, and generate plots and maps to visualize the data and results.


# Generated Outputs
The code generates several visualizations to analyze the COVID-19 data, including:

Line plots showing the homogeneity of CSIR, WCSIR, SIR, and WSIR over time.
Line plots showing the CSTR and STR over time.
Line plots and interactive versions of CSIR, SIR, LPR, WCSIR, and other variables for specific countries.
Maps representing the WCSIR values for specific dates.
The plots and maps provide insights into the trends and patterns of COVID-19 data, including the positivity rates, homogeneity of ratios, and geographical distribution of WCSIR values.

Please refer to the code comments and the visualizations generated by the code for a detailed understanding of the results.
